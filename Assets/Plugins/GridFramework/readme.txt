You can find the documentation for Grid Framework under "Help/Grid
Framework Documentation" in your Unity menu bar. Everything else is
explained in that HTML documentation. The documentation consists of two
parts: the user manual and the API reference. Use the navigation bar to the
left to browse the manual topics and use the search bar in to top
right-hand corner to quickly find the reference for classes and methos you
want to use.
