<div class="textblock"><p>In this chapter we will take a broad overview of the grids in Grid Framework and how they fit together. All grids are inside the <code><a class="el" href="namespace_grid_framework_1_1_grids.html">GridFramework.Grids</a></code> namespace.</p>
<p>In order to use a class in your namespace you have to explicitly import that namespace. In C# you need to put the following line at the head of your script:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">using</span> <a class="code" href="namespace_grid_framework.html">GridFramework</a>.<a class="code" href="namespace_grid_framework_1_1_grids.html">Grids</a>;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>If you are using UnityScript the line is as follows:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">@import GridFramework.Grids;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Namespaces are used to group classes into categories and avoid name collisions. There can be different classes with the same name as long as they are in different namespaces. Grid Framework has also separate namespaces for renderers, extension methods and support for third-party plugins as well. We will cover those in their own chapters.</p>
<p>Each grid has a number of defining properties (such as <code>Spacing</code> and <code>Shearing</code> for rectangular grids) and coordinate conversion methods. They also define types for every coordinate system and events that get triggered when the properties of a grid change.</p>
<p>Additional functionality for the different grid types are provided as official extension methods. These are methods that are not strictly tied to the act of "being a grid", so they don't belong into the class itself, and they can be implemented without performance overhead using just the public API exposed by the grid classes.</p>
<h2>The <code>Grid</code> class </h2>
<p>This is an abstract class, meaning that all grids have to inherit from it. It does not expose any public API, only protected methods that need to be implemented when writing your own grids. Since there is no public API exposed it is irrelevant to end users.</p>
<h2>The <code>LayeredGrid</code> class </h2>
<p>Layered grids are 2D grids that are stacked on top of each other as "layers" to extend them into the third dimension. Unlike <code>Grid</code>, <code>LayeredGrid</code> does in fact expose public API: the <code>Depth</code> is the distance between two layers measured in world units and there are public events that go along with the depth; the vector <code>Forward</code> is a vector from one layer to another.</p>
<p>Layered grids are abstract and hexagonal and polar grids are concrete implementations of the concept. Layered grids are embedded in the <code>XY</code>-plane and you have to rotate their object if you want to orient them differently.</p>
<h2>The <code>RectGrid</code> class </h2>
<p>Rectangular grids are your standard cuboid boxes, but they can also be sheared into a parallelepiped shape. Parallelepiped would be better name, but the name of rectangular grids was their original name, so it has stuck.</p>
<h2>The <code>SphereGrid</code> class </h2>
<p>Spherical grids consist of concentric spheres that are sub-divided by parallel circles are meridian lines, similar to geographic coordinates on a planet's surface.</p>
<h2>The <code>PolarGrid</code> class </h2>
<p>Polar grids are concentric circles that are sub-divided into sectors. Being layered grids they actually form a cylinder, but the name "polar grid" has stuck, similar to the name of rectangular grids.</p>
<h2>The <code>HexGrid</code> class </h2>
<p>Hexagonal grids are layered grids as well and consist of regular hexagons that can be arranged in a number of ways. They have to most coordinate systems and renderers out of any grid.</p>
<h2>Computed properties </h2>
<p>Aside from the <em>defining</em> properties the grids also have <em>computed</em> properties. These are properties which are not accessing fields actually stored in the grid but provide values that are computed on the fly. Some of these properties are writable as well, but instead of writing directly to a field the value get modified and instead one of the defining values is implicitly written to.</p>
<p>To make a concrete example consider the <code>Width</code> property of the <code>HexGrid</code> class. The width of a hexagon is twice its radius, so when reading the property you are actually executing the code</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keywordflow">return</span> Radius * 2f;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>When you are writing to the <code>Width</code> the inverse happens, we assign the radius half the value of the width.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">Radius = value / 2f;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Some computed properties can be viewed in the inspector where their values update according to the defining values. In the scripting reference computed properties are clearly described as such. </p>
