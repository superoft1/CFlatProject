<div class="textblock"><p>Grid Framework version 2.0 is a major rewrite of the previous version 1.x releases. Being a major version number increase, this release has broken compatibility with the version 1.x API. This chapter is intended for users of previous releases who wish to make their code work with version 2.0 and higher.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This chapter replaces the old "legacy support" chapter of the version 1.x manual</dd></dl>
<h2>Changed Features </h2>
<h3>Namespaces instead of prefixes</h3>
<p>Version 1.x was targeted at a version of Unity that had flawed support for custom namespaces. This is no longer the case and we can use namespaces to avoid name collision. You have to remove every <code>GF</code> prefix from class names and instead import the proper namespace of the class. For example <code>GFRectGrid</code> becomes just <code>RectGrid</code> and you have to import the <code><a class="el" href="namespace_grid_framework_1_1_grids.html">GridFramework.Grids</a></code> namespace.</p>
<h3>Do not use <code>Grid</code> anymore</h3>
<p>Version 1.x encouraged the use of the <code>GFGrid</code> class (now renamed <code>Grid</code>) by having a number of public methods and properties in it. This turned out fairly useless and after the cleanup there is nothing public left anymore. This makes references to <code>Grid</code> useless in most cases. Grids just aren't polymorphic enough.</p>
<h3>Extension methods</h3>
<p>Some methods have been made into extension methods rather than being part of the grid classes themselves. These are methods which do not serve the task of "being a grid" and which are efficiently implemented using only the public methods and properties provided by their classes.</p>
<h4>Nearest and alignment methods</h4>
<p>The <code>NearestVertex</code> method is one example of a method that has been factored out (<code>NearestBox</code> has been renamed <code>NearestCell</code>). <code>NearestFace</code> only exists for the layered grids now, for the others you will have to write it as a combination of the results from <code>NearestVertex</code> and <code>NearestCell</code>.</p>
<p>Alignment methods are only defined for rectangular and hexagonal grids because that's where they make the most sense. Scale methods are only defined for rectangular grids.</p>
<h3>Rendering tasks have been factored out</h3>
<p>Anything related to rendering and drawing has been removed from the grids and been made its own class. If your code relies on the <code>renderFrom</code> of a grid you have to instead reference the <code>From</code> of a renderer instead.</p>
<p>Renderers have their own notion of what a range is. In version 1.x all grids shared a <code>renderFrom</code> and <code>renderTo</code> property, but this universal data did not make sense for all grids. In version 2.0 the data depends on the type of renderer.</p>
<h3><code>GridChangedDelegate</code> and events</h3>
<p>This type has been replaced in favour of more specific delegates and events for individual properties.</p>
<h2>Moved into the renderer classes </h2>
<p>The following properties and methods have been moved from the grids to the renderers.</p>
<p><code>renderMaterial</code> is now the <code>Material</code> property of renderers, <code>renderLineWidth</code> is <code>LineWidth</code>, and <code>axisColors</code> is <code>ColorX</code>, <code>ColorY</code> and <code>ColorZ</code>.</p>
<h2>Removed features </h2>
<p>Some features have been removed completely. These were features that served no practical purpose when they can be easily implemented in a different way just as efficiently.</p>
<h3><code>GFColorVector3</code> and <code>GFBoolVector3</code></h3>
<p>These two classes have been removed entirely without any replacement. <code>GFColorVector3</code> had been used only in one instance where it has now been replaced by three individual <code>Color</code> properties. <code>GFBoolVector3</code> is no loner needed.</p>
<h3><code>RenderGrid</code> and <code>DrawGrid</code></h3>
<p>These have been removed completely in favour of the new rendering pipeline.</p>
<h3><code>useSeparateRenderColor</code> and <code>renderAxisColors</code></h3>
<p>You can set separate colours instead at runtime using scripting by setting the values of <code>ColorX</code>, <code>ColorY</code> and <code>ColorZ</code>.</p>
<h3><code>hideGrid</code>, <code>hideOnPlay</code> and <code>hideAxis</code></h3>
<p>When you set the alpha value of a colour to zero that axis will not get rendered. You can disable all rendering by disabling the renderer component itself.</p>
<h3><code>size</code>, <code>relativeSize</code> and <code>useCustomRenderRange</code></h3>
<p>These are leftover from very early releases; <code>size</code> was like setting <code>renderFrom</code> and <code>renderTo</code> to opposite values, so set your renderer's range accordingly. Whether sizes are relative depends on the renderer (they are in all the official ones).</p>
<h3><code>originOffset</code></h3>
<p>You should make your grid object the child of another object and move it accordingly.</p>
<h3><code>GFGridPlane</code> type and <code>plane</code> of layered grids</h3>
<p>Layered grids no long have a <code>plane</code>, instead they always default to an <em>XY</em>-plane. You should instead rotate your grid the way you want it to be. </p>
