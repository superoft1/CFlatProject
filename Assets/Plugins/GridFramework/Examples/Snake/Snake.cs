// In the grid-based movement example I demonstrated how to move square by
// square.  Here it is taken one step further, an entire chain of objects are
// moved. we store all segments (including the head) in a list and issue
// movement for all of them in each turn. The head is moved manually and all
// other segments take the psotion of their predecessor. The actual nake object
// is not moved at all, instead it just manages the semgents.
// 
// This example demonstrates how a simple concept (moving from square to
// sqaure) can be used to solve a problem that appears to be more complex.
// Instead of moving each segment we just move the head and have the other
// segments follow it.
